Overall:
 - Not all functions understand that NULL means never bother it.
 - OpenGL doesn't work on the gnome panel and on the dock in WindowMaker.
 - Tell me!
 - The new --gai-*-this command line argument doesn't work correctly.
   (or?)
 - Change GTK theme makes some applets loose their graphics. 

Preference Window
 - GAI_EDITLISTSTORE and GAI_LISTSTORE is not completly finished,
   therefore buggy.
   
WindowMaker:
 - Open GL does not work
 - Starting an applet from an icon should make the applet dock into that
   icon. That does not happen.
   
Gnome panel (v2.0.x and v2.2.x):
 - If you select a different background colour or image, the boarder
   around will still be gray. (This is actually a gnome panel feature
   but a very annoying one.)
 - Transparency and background images don't work! Again, the panel
   has problems.
   
Gnome panel (v2.4.0 and later)
 - The applet background becomes wrong if you use something else than
   normal settings. (Not even colour works now!)
 - The panel is two pixels wider in normal bg mode than in any other bg mode.
 - Is the applet not notified when the background changes? My fault?
 
See TODO for more things that shall be done.

PLEASE PLEASE don't fill in any bug reports in bugzilla, sourceforge.net,
dockapps.org and at some other place. I don't have the time to go around
and check them. PLEASE mail bug reports/problems to me directly. Thanks!
