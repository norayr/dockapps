The two programs in this directory, gtk-panel and gtk-dock are there to
illustrate how easy it is to add support for gai applets into any
program. Both requires GTK+ v2.x.x.

I plan to write a pure Xlib example, for those that dislike GTK+.
(Request will definitly improve the changes that it will be made.)


At the moment, the communication between the program and the GAI applet
is limited to enviromental variables, but if someone wishes and motivates,
some socket communication could be added.

The size request is abit primitive at the moment. It in relationship to
64, which is the default size. For applets with another size, it will
be abit strange. (A fix is in the todo list)

gtk-dock syntax:
./gtk-dock

gtk-panel syntax:
./gtk-panel [--size XX] applets..
exampel:
./gtk-panel --size 56 gai-pal gai-va
(Starts the panel with GAI Pal and GAI Visual audio of size 56x56 each.)
