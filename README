		    General Applet Interface Library - GAI
		    
Thanks for downloading and trying GAI!

This library is intended to simplify the development and use of
Dockapps, ROX panel applets and Gnome 2 Panel Applets. With this 
library the programmer can focus on what the applet shall do, 
not on the interface.

What this library provides:
 - Dockapp support.
 - Gnome 2 Panel support.
 - ROX panel support. (BETA)
 - Handeling of all sizes of the Gnome Panel. 
   From the programs view, the size is always the same.
 - Handle Gnome Panel rotation.
 - Simple image file handeling via gdk_pixbuf.
 - Loading and storing of configuration values and strings.
 - A simple structual way of making preferences window.
   Very little code needed.
 - Generates images from ascii text based upon fonts.
 - Support for both Gnome 2 Panel Applets, ROX panel applets and 
   Dockaps/wmapplets.
   The applet programmer doesn't have to bother about what the user
   will use.
 - Support for OpenGL applets.
 - Simple interface to connect events, like mouse button clicks, joystick
   events and so on.
 - Easy to add support for other panels.
 - Nice configure and makefile scripts that generates the needed files
   for ROX and Gnome.
 - All you applet programmers wish for! ;-)

 See docs/ for more.

See the ChangeLog for a detailed list of changes between the versions.

PLEASE PLEASE don't fill in any bug reports in bugzilla, sourceforge.net, 
dockapps.org and at some other place. I don't have the time to go around
and check them. PLEASE mail bug reports/problems to me directly. Thanks!
