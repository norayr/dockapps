 How to install Sherman's aquarium as a Xscreensaver hack
==========================================================

First make sure that you have libSDL 1.2.x (www.libsdl.org),
xscreensaver (www.jwz.org/xscreensaver) and that you have compiled
Sherman's aquarium with Screensaver support.
(Notice that some distributions differes the library and the
headers. So make sure you have installed the "devel" package
of SDL, if you use such a distribution.)

The rest of the text in this file assumes that you have a 
working xscreensaver installation.

If you have installed the screensaver part of Sherman's aquarium
executing "shermans" will demostrate Sherman's aquarium.
So try:

shermans

(Assuming that you have sherman's aquarium in your path)
This will show you sherman's aquarium screensaver in window mode.

Then go on and edit ~/.xscreensaver (If you don't have such a file,
run xscreensaver-demo, it will generate one for you.)

Find the line:
--
programs:
--

Insert after that line a new line that says:

--
"Sherman's aquarium" shermans -root \n\
--

Save the changes.

Now you have to see if the Xscreensaver configuration XML file did
end up correctly. Default installation path for GNU programs is
/usr/local/, while program that comes with distributions nearly always
is installed in /usr/
So if you didn't give --prefix=somethingelse to "configure", the 
Xscreensaver XML configuration file for Sherman's aquarium(shermans.xml) 
did end up in:

/usr/local/share/control-center/screensavers

If "shermans.xml" is the only file there, the Xscreensaver is configured
with another path. Maybe /usr/share/control-center/screensaver
See if you have that directory, and if it contains a lot of .xml files
then move the shermans.xml into that directory.

If you can't find the directory, search for "ant.xml", which is a
xscreensaver hack that is installed by default.

Now it's time to configure Sherman's aquarium and the Xscreensaver.
Run xscreensaver-demo. Click on the settings button to configure
the apperence of Sherman's aquarium. If the settings window is
empty, Xscreensaver can't find "shermans.xml" and if you can't
find "Sherman's aquarium" among the Hacks, you might have done
something wrong when you edited your ~/.xscreensaver file.

I think you have to restart the Xscreensaver daemon when you change
settings, but I might be wrong on that point.

If you want to use "Current desktop as background", i.e. let the fish
swim over your screen without changing the background, sometimes you
have to click in the "Grab Desktop Images" checkbox in the "Advanced"
menu in xscreensaver-demo (Just besides Display Modes) or else you
might end up with an error message that says something like "Bad Access". 

The comic strips that are included by default in the Sherman's Lagoon
windows screensaver is included in Sherman's aquarium too and
can normally be found in:

/usr/share/pixmaps/shermans/strips/

(When installed with --prefix=/usr)
