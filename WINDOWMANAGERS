 Status of different Window Managers and panels with GAI 0.5.4:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Please mail me <cja@gmx.net> statuses of untested window managers,
specially if there is a problem!

 Works prefect:
----------------
 * BlackBox - 0.64.0alpha7, 0.65.0
 * FluxBox - 0.1.14, 0.96pre1 
 * KDE - 3.? (Kicker's dockapp panel)
 * Waimea - 0.4.0


 Some flaws:
-------------
 * Enlightenment - 0.16.5/0.16.6 
	- Only accepts applets of size 64x64 
	  A patch for 0.16.6 can be found in the directory patches/
	  (Just do "patch -p0 <the_patch above the enlightenment src
	  tree and compile)

 * Fvwm2 - 2.4.7 
	- Only accepts applets of size 64x64
	- Configure .fvwm2rc like 
	   *FvwmButtons: (2x2, Swallow gai-pal `Exec gai-pal`)

 * Gnome - 2.0.x, 2.2.x, 2.4.x
	- No OpenGL support.

 * ROX Panel 2
	- Basic support. Pretty BETA at the moment.

 * WindowMaker - 0.80.1, 0.80.2 
	- Only accepts applets of size 64x64
	- When a dialog is displayed and closed, the icon for it is still there.
	- OpenGL support doesn't work!

 * IceWM - 1.2.14pre*
    	- Works fine in standalone mode (tested with icewm-1.2.14pre*)
    	- No dock support. IceWM does provide support for NetWM compliant
      	  (GNOME/KDE) systray apps, but obviously either in a way that GAI
      	  doesn't detect/like, or IceWM doesn't detect/like GAI's request
      	  for a systray application/icon. It would probably not look good
      	  anyway, as IceWM's taskbar/systray area is only about 24 pixels
      	  high. :-)
    	- Sample configuration for gai-album (set in ~/.icewm/winoptions):

	Gai-album.icon: gai-album-icon.png
	gai-album.icon: gai-album-icon.png
	gai-album.gai-album.geometry: 64x64-0-25
	gai-album.gai-album.tray: Ignore
	gai-album.gai-album.ignoreTaskBar: 1
	gai-album.gai-album.dTitleBar: 0
	gai-album.gai-album.dSysMenu: 0
	gai-album.gai-album.dBorder: 0
	gai-album.gai-album.dResize: 0
	gai-album.gai-album.dClose: 0
	gai-album.gai-album.dMinimize: 0
	gai-album.gai-album.dMaximize: 0


 Untested/Missing dock:
------------------------
 * Afterstep
 * Fvwm95 
 * Hackbox
 * Metacity

 Not supported for the moment:
-------------------------------
 * Gkrellm
	- Maybe
 * Gnome 1.x
	- Never will be supported
 * KDE (native applets)
	- Planned, but help with KDE/QT programming would be very apprechated!
 * XFCE 4 
	- Planned.
