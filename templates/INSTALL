These are the general installation instructions for GAI applets. 

Make sure that you have gai installed. If not, you can
get it at http://gai.sourceforge.net
Then do:
./configure
make
(change to root)
make install

If you're running the Gnome Panel, you have to restart the panel
in order to see the newly installed applet.
