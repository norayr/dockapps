 Future plans
==============

 0.5.x serie:
-------------
 - Update documentation - Preference window guide. (Just started.)
 - Verify that as many windowmangers as possible works.
 - KDE docking seems not to work (Eric reported) (Not verified)
 - Allow size requests for dockapps. (Partly done, but behaves abit odd.)
 - Be able to change the preference window on the fly.
 - Make sure ROX panel support works good.
 - "withdraw" docking mode for window maker (see wmrack)
 - Fix so that applets started before a windowmanager gets docked. (Greg's fluxbox)
 - dpi option for fonts.
 - Test gnome 2.6 & 2.8
 - fix *-this options.
 - Notification area on KDEs Kicker something useful?
 
Planned changed for 0.6.0 serie
--------------------------------
 - Use ~/.gai instead of ~/.gnome (Some automagical import function?)
 - Introduce ~/.gai/private and safty options
 - Cryptation of sensitive data. (Library?)
 - gai_get_* -> gai_*_get; (Like: gai_get_orient -> gai_orient_get)
 - gai_load_raw_data_with_default(..) instead of gai_load_raw_data(..)
 - gai_init -> removed or gai_init_develop? gai_init_simple?
 - gai_init2 -> gai_init
 - gai_about_text_from(..) removed.
 - Add possibility to add a function BEFORE the preference window is
   displayed, if something has to be taken care of.
 - keep gai_signal*(.. GPOINTER D)? Any use of GPOINTER D? I doubt.
 - gai_draw_raw_alpha -> gai_draw_raw(has_alpha)
 - Look over GaiCallback* and void * and see when they are needed.
 - gboolean is not needed to be return from gai_signal.
 - Maybe change to one gai_signal with options instead of many.
 - Change some int to enum.
 - mouse_button_click -> mouse_button_press
 - GAI control center?
 - gai server to make the applets talk with each other? 
 - Man pages for each function call.

 Sometime:
-----------
 - Investigate text entry on applets.
 - Investigate transperency levels for dockapp and gnome.
 - Investigate if it's possible to change the menu entries during
   runtime in gnome.
 - OpenGL in WindowMaker & Gnome Panel
 - Invesitage possibility to make GAI applets run on:
   - KDE panel -  Kicker (shared library)
   - Gkrellm (shared library)
   - xfce4 (shared library)
 - Write tutorial.
 - Converting the html reference guide to XML to it can be converted into
   man pages.
 - Investigate why GTK theme changes behaves like it does.
 - Nice configuration window for all applets including general settings.
 - Internationalization. Personally, I happy with having everything in
   english(with swedish and german dictionaries installed) so I believe
   I will not do anything on this level. But I'm willing to help if someone
   would like to put energy into it.
  
 Preference rewrite (gai_preferences2)
--------------------------------------------------------
 - OptionMenu widgets isn't sized correctly at start up. (Done with gtk+ >=2.4)
 - Support the new gtk+ 2.4.0 input widgets. (Done)
 - Add hscale/vscale widget
 - Alignments are not working as they should.
