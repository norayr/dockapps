 Sherman's aquarium - Applet v3.0.1
====================================
(Formly known as Aquarium applet)

This is a wm(Window maker) applet(dockapp), Gnome 2 Panel Applet and
a XscreenSaver "hack" that gives you an aquarium with some randomly 
selected fishes that lives there. Well, to tell you the truth, you 
can get some other strange sea animals in your aquarium too.
It can display the status of alot of different things in various ways.

The fishes are done by Jim Toomey, the author of the "Sherman's Lagoon"
comics.


Fish Images:
------------

The fish images are taken from a freeware windows screen saver by 
Jim Toomey.(www.slagoon.com) He draws a really great cartoon strip 
named "Sherman's lagoon". (You can ready a daily strip at his site,
and in many news papers.)
I have to point out that NO reverse engineering nor disassembling
of the code was made in order to extract the fish images. I did 
just look at the hex code and wrote a program that read the 
interesting parts, and converted them to readable images.
So the fish images are copyrighted by Jim Toomey, and released
in his screensaver as freeware. 
I've manage to get in contact with Jim Toomey and he told me
he likes "Sherman's aquarium" and that it's ok that I use that
name for my program. But he didn't give me permission to use
his graphics, but neither did he tell me to remove his graphics,
which I'm very thankfull for. (Jim, THANKS ALOT!!)


History:
--------

I saw the "Sherman's lagoon" screensaver for Windows about 1997 or so.
From the very start I wanted to have it for Linux too. Quite quick I 
made a program that extracted the graphics and the sounds. Then I 
tried to make a screensaver, but I  got stuck in gtk+/gdk problems 
that I couldn't solve at that time.
Then one day, years later, I played with the code Timecop's 
wmfishmon code, and years later this is the result.

If you enjoy this small program, please send me (Jonas Aaberg <cja@gmx.net>)
an email. For every email I get, the chances that I add new features 
and/or make other applets get larger. (Please include Sherman's 
aquarium in the subject.)

Patches, constructive critizism, extra features, sudjestions(good ones :-), 
better graphics, pizzas,.. are very welcome! :-)

If you need help with anything, don't hessitate to contact me!

Have fun,
